# Ask-Landlord
This is an open-source project about analyzing landlords' contributions to their places.

Objectives. I introduce a new perspective in analyzing a property’s managers role through an analysis of self-reported finances. In doing so, my goal is to explore the hypothesis of financial resources being tied to perceived disorder and to contribute to the place management literature. 

Methods. I make use of the survey data to construct a disorder scale that translates into a count variable of the perceived disorder. My experiment extracts data from the Property Owners and Managers Survey during 1995–1996 to analyze perceived disorder through a Poisson Regression. Additionally, I provide STATA15 code in order to facilitate a more open-source environment.

Results. Results demonstrate weak results from the Poisson regression with only three significant findings depending on how disorder was coded and what controls were introduced. Regardless of how much of the owner’s income they spent, time, or amount spent on cleaning, results suggest that the owner’s fall into the trap of the sunken costs fallacy. 

Conclusions. I show that financial investments have little influence on the overall perceived disorder in a property. The results imply that disorder and criminal acts are more tied to the quality of management. Future studies should observe the differences in management between high and low crime places.
